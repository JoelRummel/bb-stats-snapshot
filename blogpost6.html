<h3 style='display:inline-block;'>Website Update: Popular Loadouts and Use-Over-Time Graphs!</h3><span class='BlogDate'>November 2, 2018</span><br><p>Introducing the last planned major content update for BayStats! What's in stock for this one?</p>

<ul><li><a href='https://bb-stats.com/popularloadouts.php'>Popular Loadouts</a>! This page shows all of the unique item combinations that are being used most often by top players. For example, the most popular weapon combo for Speeders is currently Explosive Cannon + Flare Gun!</li>

<li>Use-Over-Time graphs! These charts can show how much an item or a ship's use rate has gone up or down in recent snapshots. Watch Speeder jump up in popularity for CTF events... and watch all the Mortars remain stuck at almost no usage despite receiving buffs! Click on any item or ship that you see on the website to see their graph.</li>

<li>Smoother animations! This one doesn't matter all that much, but it at least makes the website look a bit prettier.</li></ul>

<p>As always, if there are any issues with the website, or if you have any questions or comments... <a href='https://bb-stats.com/contact.php'>let me know</a>!</p>
