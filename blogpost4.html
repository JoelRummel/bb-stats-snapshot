<h3 style="display:inline-block;">Website Status Update</h3><span class="BlogDate">September 4, 2018</span>
<p>Hello all - I'm just posting to give an update on the status of the website. There haven't been any website updates or 
blog posts in a while... that's because I've been busy moving into college!</p>
<p>Luckily, things are settling down now, which means I can start cranking out stuff that's been on my todo list for a while...
mainly graphs that plot out item usage over time! But first I must adjust the website to align with Rovio's latest game update
("Hitting the rapid!", AKA the "Agility Update"). They've added an item and removed two others, which means that I need to spend
some time fixing up the static item dictionaries in the website's code (perhaps I should've thought that one through a little better).</p>
<p>In the meantime, the current dataset will become outdated, as I cannot perform another data scrape until the item dictionaries are 
all accurate again. Another thing to note is that the current dataset is from the Fire weekend challenge, which means that it isn't totally
representative of general item usage even before the update.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for your patience - I'll be back with another blog post once order has been restored!</p>
