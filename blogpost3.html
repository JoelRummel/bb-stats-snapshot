<h3 style="display:inline-block;">CTF Round 2: How's The Meta Shaping Up?</h3><span class="BlogDate">August 4, 2018</span>
<p>This weekend we're seeing the second iteration of the new Capture The Flag gamemode, and with it comes an unfamiliar meta.
Every other gamemode we've seen has always had the same core objective: sink the enemy. But a new objective has potential to 
seriously shake things up.</p>
<p>Shifts in use-rate statistics can help us determine which tactics are being employed among the world's best players.
Here are some of the key takeaways so far from the latest database refresh:</p>

<p><b>Speeders are back with a vengeance.</b> While Speeders generally remain quiet these days on the ladder, they've jumped
up over Enforcer in overall usage. They're even giving the Shooter a run for its money for the "Most Used Ship" position, which the Shooter
has held uncontested during much, if not all, of Battle Bay's existence. Speeders are considered invaluable as strikers in this version of CTF,
where the first capture wins the game, regardless of how much time is left on the clock.</p>

<p><b>Fixers are being used even less than before, but they are using Duct Tape much more often.</b> This gives support to the 
viability of the "Selfish Fixer" setup, which focuses on using Duct Tapes to keep itself alive, and possibly to even attempt to
capture the flag.</p>

<p><b>Defenders haven't quite found their role yet.</b> Some players predicted that a Defender could stand as a defensive juggernaut 
against flag attackers. However, as Defenders sit at a stubborn 5% use rate, it's looking like top players have deemed it inefficient 
for defense - or for anything, really.</p>

<p><b>Offensive strategies are largely the same. However, Carronade has risen in usage, while all four mortars have hit rock bottom.</b>
With so many Speeders floating about, it only made sense for some players to pick up a Carronade as a response, which can be an extremely 
effective anti-Speeder tool. Of course, Speeders and Carronades spell certain doom for mortars, which all have a stranglehold on the 
last-place positions on the item use rate chart. The speed-oriented objective of this gamemode certainly doesn't help; a good offense in this 
environment is one that can immediately and certainly dish out solid damage.</p>

<p>Luckily, with the new popularity-over-time features that I'm working on, you will soon be able to see shifts in the meta for yourself!</p>
