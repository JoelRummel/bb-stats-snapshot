<h3 style="display:inline-block;">Website Launch! and Planned Future Additions</h3><span class="BlogDate">July 29, 2018</span>
<p>Today, BayStats is born!</p>
<p>Everything here is brand new, so I encourage you to find any issues in the website, and to notify me about them.
All contact info can be found on the <a href="contact.php">Contact page</a>, so don't feel shy to shoot me a message.</p>
<p>This website isn't quite finished yet - I still have a few big features on my to-do list. The major ones include:</p>
<ul><li>A pie chart on each item page showing its usage distribution across the five ship types</li>
<li>A page for each ship, similar to how we currently have pages for each item</li>
<li>Graphs for item / ship popularity over time, showing how use rates have fluctuated</li>
</ul>
<p>With each new feature, I'll make a new Blog post, so make sure to stay tuned.</p>
