<p><b>New Use-Rate Model</b></p>
<p>Prior to this post, overall use rates for items have been calculated by simply dividing the total number of uses
by the total number of players. While technically accurate, this actually produced problems where severe differences in ship uses
would affect the overall use rates of items that tend to appear on a specific ship - which would in turn muddy the waters
as to whether the ship or the item is strong/weak.</p>
<p>Now, overall item use rates are being calculated by averaging its use rates across all five ships (or three ships, in the case of a yellow item...
 or just one ship, in the case of a green item... etc.) This gives each ship an equal representation in the final item use rate.
 For example, before using this model, if there was a huge spike in Enforcer usage, we might have also seen a concurrent spike
 in Blast Cannon usage. With the new model, Enforcer usage will rise, while Blast Cannon's usage sits still. This helps us identify
 where exactly the cores of balance differences lies.</p>
 <p>For the most part, you probably won't notice much of a difference in the item use rates - with the exception of Sniper Cannon,
 which will drop hard as a result of this change because of its heavy use on Shooters (the most popular ship).</p>
 <p><b>What's Next?</b></p>
 <p>Line graphs of item use rates over time are my highest priority right now. I can't say when exactly they'll be here, but 
 I'm hoping within the next 4-5 days or so.</p>
